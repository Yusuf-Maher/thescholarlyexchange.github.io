            Our project is a dynamic platform called The Scholarly Exchange, where you can login with an account and add any essays or works of literature that you have created to the platform. Once you do this another registered user will be able to read over and comment on your works and tell you what possible edits and changes. We created this website due to the need for a unified space where individuals can connect. Our platform acts as a bridge that works to connect emerging researchers seeking constructive feedback with veteran academics and professors to nurture and grow rising talent. Along with the first service the Scholarly Exchange also allows users to read our curated collection of cutting edge research articles to be informed and at the forefront of any scientific breakthroughs. Our platform and community are built for all researchers that want to expand their horizons whether it be a graduate student refining your first manuscript, a postdoctoral researcher exploring new methodologies, or an established professor looking to contribute to the next generation of scholarship, our platform provides the tools and community support necessary to reach new heights in STEM. Our motto is <strong><em>“empowering quality research through quality collaboration”</em></strong>, we as a group want to make sure that through equalizing access to peer reviews, we’re able to create a friendly and collaborative environment where ideas can flourish and scholarship is able to fully bloom.        </p>
